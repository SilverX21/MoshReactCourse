# MoshReactCourse

Repository for Mosh React development course
Some useful stuff for getting started:
1- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started

Below are some useful commands for the terminal
Commands:

1- npm init react-app my-app (will create a react app in the current directory, in "my-app" change to the name you want)

2-cd my-app (will put on the directory where the app is)

3- npm start (will start the app, opening in the browser)

react-app -> app for tests and many other test related things. It's where I can test feely without worrying about deleting stuff or experimenting some libraries.

counter-app -> this one has part of the course given by Mosh. It will be a counter for a shopping look alike web app :D
